<br>&emsp;&emsp; 1. Variable Types
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 2. Math & Character Operations
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 3. Logical Operations
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 4. 'while' Loops
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 5. 'for' Loops
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 6. 'if' Statements
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 7. Nesting Statements ('else')
<br>&emsp;&emsp; 7. Chaining Statements ('else if')
