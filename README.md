# Back-To-Basics
Today I'm spending time reviewing core programming principals. 
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Topics reviewed include:  
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. Variable Types
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. Math & Character Operations
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. Logical Operations
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 4. 'while' Loops
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 5. 'for' Loops
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 6. 'if' Statements
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 7. Nesting Statements ('else')
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 8. Chaining Statements ('else if')

Finally, we will conclude with a Law of Large Numbers exercise that tests our understanding of the basic programming principals.
